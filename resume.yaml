      description: |
        - Lead data scientist for developing and deploying machine learning models for payment fraud defense of our entire credit card portfolios. The models score > 700M individual payments totaling $400B (~2% US GDP) from > 40M customers per year, led to fraud savings of > $70M / yr over legacy model, and > $150M / yr overall.
        - Built reusable, well-tested, end-to-end model development pipelines, including infrastructure provisioning on AWS-EMR, data pull and feature engineering in PySpark and SQL, gradient boosting trees models in H2O, and model monitoring stack in Python, InfluxDB, and Grafana.
        - Re-wrote feature calculation and unit test codes in production from Java to PySpark, and set up CICD pipelines with pytest and Jenkins. Conducted model validation in prod, allowing on-schedule deployment.
        - Intimately involved in data scientist recruiting processes for the entire enterprise, serving as one of a handful of interviewers for on-site DS interviews, and providing feedback to shape our recruiting practices.
